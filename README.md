# ElevatorSim
Simulate the elevators of a hotel using Synchronization and Multi-threading. The goal is to send a single elevator to a floor when requested by passengers. Using multi-threading I was able to reduce the time each simulated passenger waited as well as the time elevators spent idle (stuck on a floor).
